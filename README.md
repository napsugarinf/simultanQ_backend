# simultanQ_backend

## This is the backend of my final thesis at University using the Spring Boot Framework.

The topic of my thesis is to implement an interactive quiz game without restricting
the number of participating players using a web application.
Quiz games are extremely popular nowadays and offer numerous advantages. People
enjoy challenges, especially when presented in a playful form. Live quiz games provide an
exciting and interactive experience as they allow players to compete with each other and
test their knowledge. The multiplayer mode facilitates all of this.
The fact that players participate simultaneously in the quiz game and there is the
possibility of real-time tracking of results makes the game even more thrilling and can
have a community-building impact.

The name of my application is "SimultanQ," which aims to represent this concept.
"Simultan" refers to shared, simultaneous activities, while the suffix "Q" stands for "Quiz."
Analyzing existing online and freely accessible similar applications reveals that the
number of participants is limited during the game. Within the scope of this project, a
web application has been developed without such restrictions. Users can easily register,
create quizzes after logging in, and start the game in a straightforward manner. They
can enable players to join the quiz by sharing a PIN code, and the players can access the
questions based on this information.

The application contributes to the realization of beloved challenges, the implementation
of engaging games in various topics for different groups, testing knowledge, and
the competitive approach can provide a genuine team-building experience.
